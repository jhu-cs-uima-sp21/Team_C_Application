Will: I did the find tutors functionality, some of the sign up process, and the list views on the home screens (contacted).

Danny: Made login/sign up process, connecting the Firebase user authentication with the real time database. Created confirmation page, profile tab, and a way for users to edit their profiles. Updated README.md.

Daniel: I did the home pages for both students and tutors. I created the Xmls, view model, and fragment for the home screens and did access to the firebase to access things like your subjects.

Eugene: I created the answer questions tab. Users can ask and answer questions, much like a forum, using the Firebase real time database.
